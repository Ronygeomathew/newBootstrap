          <h1><u>Sattriya</u></h1>
          <p>
            Sattriya is a classical dance form from the state of Assam, in northeastern India. It is known for its graceful movements, delicate footwork, and expressive hand gestures.

Sattriya dance has its roots in the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism, which emphasizes devotion to the god Vishnu. The dance form was developed and practiced by the monks of the Sattras, or monasteries, in Assam, as a form of worship.

Sattriya dance is characterized by its fluid and graceful movements, which are meant to convey a sense of devotion and surrender to the divine. The dance is performed to live music, which includes the khol, a type of drum, the cymbals, and the flute.

Sattriya dance features several different types of movements, including the hasta, or hand gestures, and the charis, or footwork. The dance is often performed in groups, with each dancer representing a different character or deity.

There are several different types of Sattriya dances, including the Ankiya Nat, which is a form of musical drama that tells stories from the Hindu epics, and the Sattriya Nritya, which is a form of pure dance that emphasizes the grace and fluidity of movement.

Sattriya dance was largely unknown outside of Assam until the mid-20th century, when it was revived and popularized by the renowned dancer and choreographer, Dr. Bhupen Hazarika. Since then, Sattriya dance has gained popularity both within India and internationally, and is recognized as one of the eight classical dance forms of India.

In conclusion, Sattriya dance is a beautiful and expressive classical dance form that has a rich history and cultural significance in Assam, India. Its graceful movements, delicate footwork, and expressive hand gestures continue to captivate audiences around the world. The dance form has evolved over time, but it remains deeply rooted in the culture and traditions of Assam and is an important part of the state's heritage.
